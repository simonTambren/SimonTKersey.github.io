	Also out of the 200 kids that got picked out of the states I got picked to give a speech</br>
	at the house of representatives in front of a few congressmen. </br>

	<img src="LAH_LOGO.jpg" alt="" />
	<h2> Some song lyrics:</h2> <p id="song">"I'm not hiding it. My bandage too thin it doesn't hide. Even though i try.</br>
	You can clearly see what's inside. So i pump up my music and look outside.</br>
	See the snow fly by and know i'm still alive. </br>
	I call out to the empty darkness waiting for a reply. </br>
	Instead of defining silence i get the reply of keep trying.</br> 
	The me's inside me who came to be. Another person living and breathing.</br>
	Tells me to keep my heart beating. </br>
	Look for the major lift in life don't trip on the minor fall because</br>
	like a song it rises again." </p>
	<p>I write books and I am soon publishing the first in my series Way Back When</p>
